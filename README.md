# privefl.github.io

This is my githup repo for creating and hosting my personal website on GitHub. 

I moved from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html), mostly because I'm an R enthusiast and an RStudio fanatic :').

I now use [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/privefl/blog/tree/gh-pages) for my blog.
